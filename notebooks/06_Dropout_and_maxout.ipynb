    "\n",
    "During training the forward propagation through a dropout layer produces outputs where a subset of the input dimensions are set to zero ('dropped out'). The dimensions to be dropped out are randomly sampled for each new batch, with each dimension having a probability $p$ of being included and the inclusion (or not) of each dimension independent of all the others. If the inputs to a dropout layer are $D$ dimensional vectors then we can represent the dropout operation by an elementwise multiplication by a $D$ dimensional *binary mask* vector $\\boldsymbol{m} = \\left[m_1 ~ m_2 ~\\dots~ m_D\\right]^{\\rm T}$ where $m_d \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(p) ~~\\forall d \\in \\lbrace 1 \\dots D\\rbrace$. \n",

    "## Exercise 3: Implementing maxout\n",
    "\n",
    "[Maxout](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.4389.pdf) can be considered a generalisation of the rectified linear transformation implemented in the previous lab. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a rectified linear (`Relu`) layer the forward propagation corresponds to\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    y^{(b)}_k = \n",
    "    \\max\\left\\lbrace 0,\\,x^{(b)}_k \\right\\rbrace\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "i.e. each output corresponds to an pairwise maximum of a constant (0) and the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of taking the maximum of the input and a constant, we could instead consider taking the maximum over sets of inputs of a fixed size $s$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    y^{(b)}_k = \n",
    "    \\max\\left\\lbrace x^{(b)}_{(k-1)s + 1},\\, x^{(b)}_{(k-1)s + 2},\\, \\dots ,\\, x^{(b)}_{ks} \\right\\rbrace\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "If these inputs $x^{(b)}_d$ are themselves the outputs of an affine layer, then this corresponds to taking the maximum of a series of affine functions of the previous layer outputs. Like a rectified linear layer this leads to piecewise linear input-output relationships (which have well-behaved gradients which do not suffer from the saturation problems of logistic sigmoid / hyperbolic tangent transformations) but unlike the rectified linear case we do not end force a portion of the outputs to be zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "Experimentally this form of transformation has been found to give good performance, with the name *maxout* chosen because the *out*put is the *max*imum of a set of inputs. Maxout is also commonly used with dropout layers however note they are not directly related - maxout defines a deterministic non-linear transformation which can help improve the representational capacity and trainability of models; dropout defines a stochastic transformation which is mainly aimed at regularising a model to reduce overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using layers which take the maximum of fixed sized sets of inputs is also a common technique in models with convolutional layers which we will cover later in the course, with here the layer commonly being termed a *max-pooling* layer (with there being natural generalisation to other choices of reduction functions over pools such as the mean). We will adopt this terminology here for a layer implementing the transformation described above and we will be able to reuse our code implementing this maximum operation when experimenting with convolutional models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The partial derivatives of this max-pooling transformation are sparse (lots of values are zero), with only the partial derivative of the output of a pool with respect to the maximum input in the pool non-zero. This can be expressed as\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\frac{\\partial y^{(b)}_k}{\\partial x^{(b)}_d} = \n",

This means that their contribution to the activation of downstream neurons is temporally removed on the forward pass and any weight updates are not applied to the neuron on the backward pass. This is a form of regularisation because it means that the network cannot rely on any one neuron to be present in order for the network to operate. \n",

The effect is that the network becomes less sensitive to the specific weights of neurons. This in turn results in a network that is capable of better generalisation and is less likely to overfit the training data."
